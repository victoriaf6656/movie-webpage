    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>A girl wakes up from a long coma in a hospital bed.</p>
    <p>Confused and scared, she removes the IV and wires from her body and proceeds to leave her room.</p>
    <p>The halls of the hospital are quiet. Nobody is to be found.</p>
    <p>The lights are still on, and papers cluttered on the reception desk.</p>
    <p>It’s almost like everyone suddenly disappeared out of thin air.</p>
    <p>She yells out “Hello! Hello! Is anybody here? Where is everybody?!”.</p>
    <p>No response.</p>
    <p>She leaves the abandoned hospital and the streets are empty.</p>
    <p>The town she is in is missing the sounds of cars moving up and down the road,</p>
    <p>children laughing and playing, and angry commuters arguing over a traffic incident as usual.</p>
    <p>She feels as if she is in a nightmare, she seems to have suffered amnesia as she can’t</p>
    <p>even remember her own name, or what her own birthday is.</p>
    <p>Little did she know… She really was not alone in the town…</p>
    <p>There was something else lurking around which might explain the absence of the towns people.</p>
    <p>It is up to her to figure out what happened, and see how she perseveres through her lonely endeavors.</p>

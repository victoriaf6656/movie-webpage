    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>A girl wakes up from a long coma in a hospital bed.
    Confused and scared, she removes the IV and wires from her body and proceeds to leave her room.
    The halls of the hospital are quiet. Nobody is to be found.
    The lights are still on, and papers cluttered on the reception desk.
    It’s almost like everyone suddenly disappeared out of thin air.
    She yells out “Hello! Hello! Is anybody here? Where is everybody?!”.
    No response.
    She leaves the abandoned hospital and the streets are empty.
    The town she is in is missing the sounds of cars moving up and down the road,
    children laughing and playing, and angry commuters arguing over a traffic incident as usual.
    She feels as if she is in a nightmare, she seems to have suffered amnesia as she can’t
    even remember her own name, or what her own birthday is.
    Little did she know… She really was not alone in the town…
    There was something else lurking around which might explain the absence of the towns people.
    It is up to her to figure out what happened, and see how she perseveres through her lonely endeavors to
    figure out what happened in the time she was clinically unstable.</p>
